This is my first python app.

This is built for 16x2 screens using the Adafruit_CharLCD method.
Simply run Cryptoticker.py and you will see the usd value of 1 doge and 1 million doge, as well as the current value of 1 btc.
The values alternate every ten seconds and update every five minutes.
Just upload every file and run cryptoticker.py :D


To come:
*Add LTC
*Show percentage change upon each update
*Create web GUI to manually force an update or to only show specific cryptos
*More?
